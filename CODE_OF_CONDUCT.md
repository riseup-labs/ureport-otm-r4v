# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We solemnly pledge to dedicate this app to the service of humanity. We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We will not use our knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties. We make these promises gravely, freely, and upon our honor.

## Our Standards

## Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
1. Developing a strategy to encourage positive behavior and replace challenging behaviors.
2. Minimizing disruptive behavior with incentives or tracking.
3. Agilely receiving productive analysis.
4. Being appreciative of differing perspectives and experiences.
5. Concentrating on what is best for the community.
6. Showing insight towards other community members.

## Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
1. The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
2. Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
3. Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
4. Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are accountable for defining the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take relevant and fair remedial action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. This action can include removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions, or permanently banning any contributor for other behaviors they deem inapplicable, threatening, invasion, or harmful.
Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in public spaces when an individual is representing Connected Data or its community. Examples of representation include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
This includes project code, code repository, associated web pages, documentation, mailing lists, project websites and wiki pages, issue tracker, meetings, telecons, events, project social media accounts and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this Code of Conduct outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

The U-Report Community Standards Committee (CSC) is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior, proactively monitoring adherence to community standards, receiving and investigating complaints, and proposing appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. 

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [email]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
